Write Python code that is clean, optimized, and production-ready.
Use type annotations, PEP8 style, and meaningful variable names.
Prioritize performance and readability.
Handle edge cases and errors gracefully.
Use vectorized operations (e.g. pandas, polars) over loops where applicable.
If using async or I/O operations, prefer asyncio-friendly libraries.
Comment complex logic, and structure code in reusable functions or modules.
