Implement the functionality using Test-Driven Development (TDD).
First, write clear, minimal unit tests using pytest, describing expected inputs and outputs.
Then write just enough code to make each test pass.
Follow clean code practices, use type hints, and structure logic for testability.
Ensure tests cover edge cases, data validation, and failure scenarios.
Prioritize modular and side-effect-free code where possible.
